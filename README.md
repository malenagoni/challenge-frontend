* [âœ”] I have read the job description and understand the qualifications, the responsibilities and the compensation of this position.

1. What are you most proud of as a front-end developer?
There are many things I am proud of, especially this year. Not only as a front-end developer but as a person who is always challenging herself. 
The first thing would be the Bootcamp Henry. So many experiences in such a short time (4 months). I was a student, later became a teacher and leader.. finally a graduate, and now a mentor of a group of students. 
But if I have to say something, in particular, it would be my graduation project. I developed a project from start to finish with 9 classmates and I worked in a full-stack way but mainly as a front-end developer.
For me, it was not just about the technical skills but the teamwork and that all the effort we put into our same goal was worth it. I was so happy and proud the day we finished it. And also we were awarded as the best project of the graduation.

1. What do you enjoy most working as a front-end developer?
I love spending hours coding and creating. New challenges for me are always a new reason to be excited. But what I like the most is the opportunity to use technology, logic, and creativity to give the best user experience and joy to people. 
Also, technology is a constantly evolving field. You learn every day and you have the chance to keep growing. 
On the other hand, I like the flexibility you can have working from home or anywhere.

1. What is your favorite software development principle(s) and/or design pattern(s)?
I didn't have the chance to get further into these topics but definitely is one of the first things I want to learn soon because it's a great tool to have for solving all sorts of problems. A Udemy course is waiting for me.

1. What is the top 1 (or up to 3) accomplishments you achieved in your previous company?
My previous company was Henry. I was a teaching assistant and lead a group of 20 students.
They were from all over Latin America and our classes consisted of 1 or sometimes 2 hours a day.
Even today after graduation we still have meetings once a week to catch up.
I think that's my top 1 achievement: being able to connect people from all over through a screen and successfully guide them through an immersive bootcamp monitoring their evolution and clarifying theoretical and practical doubts.
The second achievement was that they chose my guiding and teaching methodology as an example among all the other teachers.
The third one is that I achieved this while I was still finishing my studies working on a solo project and having workshops every day.

1. How do you like TDD?
Write a test evaluating some part of code base. Run the test. Fix the code with the error message looking for satisfy the test conditions. Rerun the test. Refactor the code looking for the best solution, making the code more readable, separating it into more logical parts, and renaming or moving variables and methods. Repeat.
